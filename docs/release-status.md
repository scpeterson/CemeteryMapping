# Release status and deployment checks

## November 6, 2026: DEV

DEV was deployed at `9aec56d2b4bde06dde2491d530e78b30b12b32a6`.
The API health response identified this revision and the DEV database after the
dependency installation, DEV build and service restart. This is a dated deployment
record; later source merges do not automatically update running services.

| Change | Merged PR | DEV availability |
|---|---|---|
| Cemetery member administration | [#789](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/789) | Administration → Members |
| Concurrent edit protection | [#790](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/790) | Version checks and explicit conflict reload |
| Encrypted field collection | [#791](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/791) | Field workspace; offline shell requires a built deployment |
| Cemetery onboarding and reviewed imports | [#792](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/792) | Administration → Onboarding |
| Deleted-record recovery and person merges | [#793](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/793) | Administration → Recovery |
| CSV and GeoJSON extracts | [#794](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/794) | Export |
| Assigned maintenance work and reminders | [#795](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/795) | Tasks |

The feature release first reached DEV at `96dc8675c43bb99684f35c1e4a7b928fc519ada8`.
Migrations 513–516 were applied after a database/media backup, restricted API grants
were refreshed, and API/web services were restarted. PostgreSQL 18.6/PostGIS 3.6.4
remained in place. The later dependency-only release required no new migrations.

| Installed dependency | Version | PR |
|---|---|---|
| Vite | 8.3.5 | [#796](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/796) |
| MapLibre GL | 6.16.0 | [#797](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/797) |
| Lucide React | 1.66.0 | [#798](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/798) |
| ESLint | 10.14.0 | [#799](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping/pull/799) |

TypeScript remains 6.0.3; PR #273 was deliberately left open. See
[ADR 0204](adr/0204-maplibre-runtime-budget.md) for measured map runtime growth
and its bounded allowance; application chunk limits remain unchanged.

## Verification and limits

Each merged feature/dependency PR passed its final CI checks. Feature validation
included 310 fresh-database regressions; final dependency validation passed 854
server/unit checks. Live DEV read checks passed for members, imports, recovery,
merge search, field markers, task queues/reminders, CSV/GeoJSON exports and
protected media. Browser checks loaded the field workspace and the existing
sign-in screens for protected pages without application errors.

These deployment smoke checks did not perform a fresh interactive identity login
or write to real cemetery records. DEV's Vite server supports encrypted drafts
but does not provide the built offline shell. The observed DEV API used disabled local authentication; the frontend still
showed its sign-in screen. Personal task assignment/reminder checks require a
registered account and API authentication; a disabled-auth local session uses
the cemetery queue. A frontend login screen alone does not establish
API token validation. See [API security](https://github.com/scpeterson/CemeteryMapping#api-security)
and the [field workflow](operator-workflows.md#offline-field-collection).

## Promotion to TEST

The November 6 work deployed DEV only. It does not establish deployment of these
features or dependencies to local or hosted TEST, STAGE or PROD. Historical TEST
observations remain in the [hosted runbook](hosted-test.md). Check the live revision
and Liquibase history before selecting a candidate or migration range.

Before promoting this release, rehearse pending migrations on an isolated copy,
retain database/media recovery material, apply migrations through
`516-maintenance-task-scheduling`, refresh runtime grants, then release the matched
frontend/API. Preserve tester identities, memberships, pending imports, merge
evidence, field-operation receipts and task history. Do not seed or reset a
persistent environment as part of this release.

Verify a registered account with different roles in two cemeteries, including
member administration, denied cross-cemetery edits, conflict/draft recovery, staged
import approval, person-merge evidence, private export access and assigned task
reminders. Test built field-page preparation, offline reload and authenticated
synchronization. Keep original photo files until synchronization is confirmed.
Use the [release workflow](operator-workflows.md#environment-promotion-workflow)
and [current rebuild requirements](rebuild.md#current-schema-and-workspace-release).
